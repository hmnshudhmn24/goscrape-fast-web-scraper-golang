# 🗂 GoScrape: Fast Web Scraper with Concurrency (Golang)

**GoScrape** is a high-performance web scraper built in **Go** using Goroutines and Channels for efficient concurrency. It allows scraping of multiple target websites (e.g., news, blogs, product listings) with retry logic, error handling, and data storage in **SQLite** or **MongoDB**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ Fast concurrent scraping using Goroutines
- 🌐 Configurable target URLs
- 🔁 Retry logic and error handling
- 💾 SQLite/MongoDB integration for storing scraped data
- 📊 Modular design with reusable scraper logic
- 🧪 Logging and rate-limiting support

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Language: **Go**
- Web Scraping: **Colly**
- Concurrency: **Goroutines + WaitGroups + Channels**
- Database: **SQLite** (default) / MongoDB (optional)
- Config: **.env** file (optional)

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Define list of target URLs in `main.go`
2. For each target, launch a goroutine with `scraper.Scrape(url)`
3. Use `Colly` to scrape the content of the page
4. Store results in SQLite/MongoDB
5. Wait for all tasks to complete

## 🧪 Example Targets

```go
targets := []string{
    "https://news.ycombinator.com/",
    "https://techcrunch.com/",
}
```

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Install Go and SQLite

```bash
sudo apt install golang-go sqlite3
```

### 2️⃣ Clone Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/goscrape-fast-web-scraper-golang.git
cd goscrape-fast-web-scraper-golang
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Scraper

```bash
go run main.go
```

## 🗃️ Output Format

Each article/product is stored in the `scraped.db` SQLite database with:

- Title
- URL
- Scrape timestamp
- Source

---

## 🐛 Error Handling

- Automatic retries on HTTP failure
- Timeout/resilience handling using Colly callbacks

---

## 🐳 Optional: Docker Support

Add a Dockerfile to containerize the scraper for scheduled scraping in CI/CD or cloud.

---

## 🧩 Extend Ideas

- Add CLI flags for input URLs
- Add support for JSON/CSV export
- Schedule scraping every N minutes
- Build a web frontend to view results
